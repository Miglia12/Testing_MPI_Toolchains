# Testing_MPI_Toolchains

The goal of this project is to validate the MPI toolchains installed on the
Uni.lu HPC platform. The ReFrame framework will be used to orchestrate sets of
regression and sanity tests. We will leverage two sets of tests: the OSU
benchmarking suite [[link](http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/benchmarks/)], and
Supermagic [[link](https://github.com/hpc/supermagic)].
